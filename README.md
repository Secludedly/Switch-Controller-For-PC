## INTRODUCTION

`Switch Controller for PC` is a robust application that enables users to automate button presses on their Nintendo Switch consoles remotely. With support for multiple Switch consoles at once. Switch Controller for PC is a powerful tool for automating in-game actions, testing, and more. The application includes features for recording sequences of button presses, playing them back, as well as a Live Mode. **CFW Switch with [Sys-BotBase](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase) is required to use this!** The original project was created by [Hedge](https://github.com/CodeHedge) [here](https://github.com/CodeHedge/SysBot.Remote). His original code includes Discord controls, but mileage may vary.

## FEATURES
- **Macro Recording and Playback:** *Record sequences of button presses, store them as macros, and play them back at will. Ideal for automating repetitive in-game tasks, testing game functionality, or simulating player interactions.*
- **Multiple Switch Console Support:** *Interact with multiple Nintendo Switch consoles simultaneously. Synchronize actions across multiple games or conduct large-scale tests.*
- **Live Mode:** *Transforms into a remote controller for your Nintendo Switch console. Every button press in the application is sent in real-time to all selected switches.*
